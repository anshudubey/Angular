🚀 Spring Boot 3.4 – New Features (Since 3.3)
🔧 1. Improved Configuration & Bean Management
@Fallback Annotation: Define beans as fallback options if a primary bean is missing.

Better Constructor Binding for @ConfigurationProperties: More robust validation and binding behavior.

Custom Bean Coexistence: Now supports defining multiple beans of the same type alongside auto-configured ones.

📡 2. Observability & Monitoring
Structured Logging Support:

Log formats now support structured output (e.g., JSON, ECS, Logstash).

Configurable via logging.format and logging.group.

New Health Contributor – SSL:

Checks for certificate expiry or invalid certificates.

Enable with:

yaml
Copy
Edit
management.health.ssl.enabled=true
Extended /actuator/scheduledtasks:

Now shows:

lastExecution

nextExecution

lastCompletion and exception (if any)

New /actuator/sbom Endpoint:

Provides a Software Bill of Materials for security and supply chain audits.

Application Group Tagging:

spring.application.group to logically group instances for logs and telemetry.

🧪 3. Testing Enhancements
New Testing Annotations:

@MockitoBean and @MockitoSpyBean replace the deprecated @MockBean and @SpyBean.

Not 1:1 replacements, some limitations exist (e.g., cannot be used on @Configuration classes).

AssertJ-style MockMvcTester:

A fluent, expressive way to test Spring MVC controllers.

Improved ApplicationContextRunner for isolated config testing.

🌐 4. HTTP Client Enhancements
RestTemplate and RestClient auto-config now chooses client based on priority:

Order: Apache → Jetty → Reactor Netty → JDK HttpClient → Simple

Configure explicitly using:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.http.client.factory=apache
🐳 5. Docker & Testcontainers Support
Multi Compose File Support: Supports multiple Docker Compose files via spring.docker.compose.files.

Testcontainers Enhancements:

Support added for Redis Stack, Hazelcast, and Grafana LGTM containers.

Container Architecture Support:

Specify OS/arch in image builds (e.g., ARM64, x86_64) via Maven or Gradle plugin.

🛠️ 6. Dependency and Plugin Upgrades
Micrometer 1.12, Kafka, Hibernate, and other ecosystem libraries updated.

Support for Java 21 virtual threads:

Spring Boot 3.4 is better aligned with Java 21 features, improving performance with virtual threads (especially in reactive workloads or high-concurrency apps).
